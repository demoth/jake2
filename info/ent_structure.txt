These are the attributes which all entities have. This is an explanation of the type 
'edict_t'. Attributes are referenced by the format 'entity_name->attribute'  (eg self->angle)

Many of these will be familiar to QuakeC programers.

NOTE - Not all of these are relevant to all entities (infact there are no entities
for which all of these are relevant).
