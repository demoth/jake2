     * 1 does this message contains a reliable payload
     * 31 sequence
     * 1 acknowledge receipt of * even/odd message
     * 31 acknowledge sequence
     * 16 qport
     * 
     * The remote connection never knows if it missed a reliable message, the
     * local side detects that it has been dropped by seeing a sequence
     * acknowledge higher thatn the last reliable sequence, but without the
     * correct even/odd bit for the reliable set.
     * 
     * If the sender notices that a reliable message has been dropped, it will
     * be retransmitted. It will not be retransmitted again until a message
     * after the retransmit has been acknowledged and the reliable still failed
     * to get there.
     * 
     * if the sequence number is -1, the packet should be handled without a
     * netcon (Connectionless/out-of-band packet)
     * 
     * The reliable message can be added to at any time by doing MSG_Write*
     * (&netchan.message, <data>).
     * 
     * If the message buffer is overflowed, either by a single message, or by
     * multiple frames worth piling up while the last reliable transmit goes
     * unacknowledged, the netchan signals a fatal error.
     * 
     * Reliable messages are always placed first in a packet, then the
     * unreliable message is included if there is sufficient room.
     * 
     * To the receiver, there is no distinction between the reliable and
     * unreliable parts of the message, they are just processed out as a single
     * larger message.
     * 
     * Illogical packet sequence numbers cause the packet to be dropped, but do
     * not kill the connection. This, combined with the tight window of valid
     * reliable acknowledgement numbers provides protection against malicious
     * address spoofing.
     * 
     * 
     * The qport field is a workaround for bad address translating routers that
     * sometimes remap the client's source port on a packet during gameplay.
     * 
     * If the base part of the net address matches and the qport matches, then
     * the channel matches even if the IP port differs. The IP port should be
     * updated to the new value before sending out any replies.
     * 
     * 
     * If there is no information that needs to be transfered on a given frame,
     * such as during the connection stage while waiting for the client to load,
     * then a packet only needs to be delivered if there is something in the
     * unacknowledged reliable
